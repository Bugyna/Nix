# Nix-editor
Text editor made with python(3), tkinter and a bunch of other stuff

I started making this before I discovered how good Visual Studio Code actually is and I just kinda continued uprgrading it for fun. It's not perfect or even good but it's kinda usable; It has a syntax highlighter which basically supports Python and C (will add C++ support soon) it can save a file too so it does basically everything I need. I will have to add a Redo somehow though. It has a bunch of commands too, there's also some other themes besides the default dark (cake) one.

to get to the command line press Control+Space

todo:
- add functions to right-click pop-up window
- add more commands and their description and also refactor the parsing command because now it's somewhat sketchy and it can probably be done better
