# Nix
Text editor made with python(3), tkinter and a bunch of other stuff

Trash editor, don't use (or use it's pretty alright if you know how to use it)
provides some syntax highlighting (a bunch of different themes too, you can write your own somewhat easily, themes are stored in theme_conf.json), sort of autocompletion, searching, shortcuts for launching/running/compiling current file/project

look at keybinds_conf.json to get an idea of what keybindings are available
control+space gets you to the builtin "console" which you can use to do some stuff (type help in it for some help)

you can write your own modules too, in a way, if you have some knowledge of tkinter you could add your own widgets and stuff (check out src/modules/ for idea)

a detailed tutorial will be coming when I am done which is probably going to take a while
untill then you can try and understand the maddness my code is
