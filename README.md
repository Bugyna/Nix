# n-editor
Text editor made with tkinter

todo:
- scrolling through command history //done
- fix unnecesary error windows //basically done
- fix line wrapping(tkinter text wrapping doesn't work the way I want it to)
- make highlighting work properly aka make something like regex that will look for words and not matches(if that makes sense) //done
- add functions to right-click pop-up window
- add more commands and their description and also refactor the parsing command because now it's somewhat sketchy and it can probably be done better
